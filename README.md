# Tasheer

Tasheer is a simple Classified Forum written in NodeJS/Express. It is using MySQL as a database engine.

## Instructions

Once you clone it:

- run `npm install`
- run `gulp` to copy asset files in `public` folder.

## Status
The project was aimed to learn Node/Express basics. I have not implemented search, edit and a few logical modules for instance login and Admin. You are free to implement.
